# Terraform Template Builder

## Overview

Terraform Template Builder is a graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to simplify the creation of Terraform templates. It provides an intuitive interface for users to design and configure infrastructure-as-code deployments without manually writing Terraform configuration files.

This tool is intended to streamline the process of building Terraform templates, making it more accessible for users who prefer visual design workflows or are new to Terraform.

## At this time, the GUI is in development and following this the code will be created to link the selections made to creating the files for deployment.

## Features

- GUI-based interface for creating Terraform templates
- Support for common Terraform resources and modules
- Real-time preview of generated Terraform code
- Export functionality for saving templates to `.tf` files
- Validation of input parameters and configurations

## Benefits

- Reduces the learning curve for new Terraform users
- Minimizes manual coding errors
- Accelerates infrastructure design and deployment workflows
- Enables collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders

## Still in production, more work needed
