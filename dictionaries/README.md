Fun with dictionaries

This is a simple project to practice parsing information returned in a dictionary containing multiple lists.
Along with main.py are data.py with a simple dictionary, and nested_dictionary.py for something more complex.

main.py features a function for each of the additional files and allows searching each one for a name. These functions
can be copied or otherwise modfied to allow searching for other pieces of information in each data file.
